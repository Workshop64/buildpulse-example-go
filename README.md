# BuildPulse Example Project: Go (Golang)

This is an example Go project demonstrating how to send test results to [BuildPulse](https://buildpulse.io) to help you identify and eliminate flaky tests.

If you have an existing Go project building on CircleCI, this [diff](https://github.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-example-go/compare/067dce27b86288a53d76be11763b27e61d2325b5...master) shows how to set up your `.circleci/config.yml` to send test results to BuildPulse.
